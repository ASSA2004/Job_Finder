# Job_Finder
This Python script implements a job-matching application using machine learning concepts. It processes a user's CV file and compares its content with predefined job descriptions to recommend the best matches. The script uses TF-IDF vectorization to compute similarities between the CV and job descriptions and ranks the jobs based on their relevance.
